Welcome to my blog.  I've been thinking about doing this for a while now, and when I learned that my github account came with a free blog I figured the time was right.

My plan is to post here about various sysadmin topics, personal projects, new recipes that I've tried, and anything else that interests me.  You have been warned.

First up (my next post) will be detailing the process I went through to get this blog up and running.
